# Hey World as an API

Make a REST API out of the RSS feed for your Hey World site.

Clone this repository and deploy it to Netlify

Add your RSS Feed URL as an enivronment variable called `RSS_URL`. 

You can do this in the Netlify UI at 'Site settings -> Build & Deploy -> Environment'.

You can also use a `.env` file

There's a working version here:
